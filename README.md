This app uses [Microsoft365R](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft365R) for programmatically accessing sharepoint. This is just a wrapper around Microsoft365R to expose an interface we want to use for interacting with sharepoint from orderly.


## Authentication

See [Microsoft365R docs](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft365R#authentication).


## Tests

Most of the tests make heavy use of mocks, so if the API changes we might not catch breaking changes. In order to hedge against this we run a small number of integration tests against sharepoint. To opt into running these tests you need to define some environment variables:

```
SPUD_TEST_SHAREPOINT_USERNAME=you@example.com
SPUD_TEST_SHAREPOINT_PASSWORD=s3cret!
SPUD_TEST_SHAREPOINT_HOST=https://example.sharepoint.com
SPUD_TEST_SHAREPOINT_SITE=yoursite
SPUD_TEST_SHAREPOINT_ROOT=path/on/your/site
```

This will create a new directory on your sharepoint site below the path given at `SPUD_TEST_SHAREPOINT_ROOT`, one per time the test suite is run, and it will add, list, remove files that are there.
