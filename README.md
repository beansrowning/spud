Package to enable programmatic downloading of data from sharepoint.

Authenticates using pattern detailed https://paulryan.com.au/2014/spo-remote-authentication-rest/

There is a package exists on github for managing lists - not clear whether this will work with downloading any data as package doesn't work with most basic example of retrieveing all available lists
